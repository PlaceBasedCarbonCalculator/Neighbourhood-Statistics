# Neighbourhood Statistics
A backup of the lost neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk data

Around 2011 the Office for National Statistics maintained a website [neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk](neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk) which is now closed and is not in the National Archives or the [Way Back Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20051001000000*/neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk). The website was a useful repository of small area statistics, and much of the historical data (pre-2011) now seems to be missing from the public internet, or at least I can't find it.

This repo contains my collection of data from this site that I collected as part of my PhD. I have uploaded it to GitHub in case others are interested in historical small area datasets.

It is provided as is, I don't have documentation or anything other than what is included in this repo.

The data is provided in zipped folders organised roughly the same way they were on the original website. These datasets predate the Open Government Licence, so their licensing is unclear. However, the data was free to download at the time, and so I assume it was licensed accordingly.
