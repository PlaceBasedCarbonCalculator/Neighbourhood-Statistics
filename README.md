# Neighbourhood Statistics
A backup of the lost neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk data

Around 2011 the Office for National Statistics maintained a website [neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk](neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk) which is now closed and is not in the National Archives or the [Way Back Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20051001000000*/neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk). The website was a useful repository of small area statistics, and much of the historical data (pre-2011) now seems to be missing from the public internet. 

This repo contains my collection of data from this site. It is provided as is, I don't have documentation or anything other than what is included in this repo.
